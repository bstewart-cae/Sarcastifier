# Project Title

Sarcastifer

## Description

Joke app I wrote to remove the tedium of make sarcasm more visible in text format.

## Getting Started

Download, run, type in text that is going to an email to that sibling, news anchor, or dog groomer that you can't stand. The Sarcastifier will spit out preformatted text that will make all sarcasm abundantly clear. 

### Dependencies

You'll need to install .NET 6 runtimes to get this to run.
